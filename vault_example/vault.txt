we doon't need to pass the vaault password each time when we are executing the playbook. 

There are two alternaticve ways we can handle this.

Step1 :  store the password in a txt file and change the mode to 600(only owner)
            echo 'your_vault_password' > ~/.ansible_vault_pass.txt
            chmod 600 ~/.ansible_vault_pass.txt
Step2: two ways to ask ansible to fetch the password from this file, 
        - instead of --ask-vault-password, use --vault-password-file like below, 
            ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file ~/.ansible_vault_pass.txt
        
        - But the recommended way is to update this file in the ansible configuration file as an environment varible
            like, 
                # ansible.cfg
                [defaults]
                vault_password_file = ~/.ansible_vault_pass.txt
                
                then we don't need to pass the creds in the CLI.
